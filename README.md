# chicken-cross-the-road

Team project, developed in 5 days, by a team of four members, during the <Academia de CÃ³digo_> #47 bootcamp.

# //The idea
A simple Java game where the player controls a chicken in a road full of moving cars. The objective is to cross the road without being hit by any car. If the player reaches the end of the road, the score increases by one, and the chicken goes to it's starting position. The difficulty increases each level, by increasing the ammount and speed of cars in the road. When the chicken gets hit, the game is lost and the player needs to start over from level one. The objective is to get the maximum possible score.

# //Tech && Methodologies
Java, Simple Graphics Library, Ant

When we worked on this project, every member had only about 3 weeks of experience in programming. 
The simple graphics library was the first ever library we learned about, 2 days before we start the project.
